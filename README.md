# Hempbot-repo
The Hemp Bot is an educational car kit for kids from 8 to 16, designed to learn the basics electronics and coding. 
HempBot is designed to have a minimum use of metal parts and screws and the project have two versions:

V1 is made entirely of hemp bioplastic, with the only use of 3D printing (this technology is easier to find for a school )

V2 instead is made with a purely wooden frame, laser cutted;  and the tracked wheels are the same used in HempbotV1.

Hempbot is especially designed to give children a toy that is safe in the materials used, in this, we confirm the use of hemp bioplastics, this technology not only offer not only offer the user of the toy greater safety deriving from a material, but offers a high degree of maneuverability, deriving from the extreme lightness and strength of the material . Another goal of HempBot is to offer the child the possibility to build his own car to be programmed in an easy, autonomous and exciting way. HemBot is a low cost educational robotics kit, consisting of an Arduino board and a motorshield, and is already set up to host upgrades and add-ons.

**Machine Used:** 3D Printer - Laser CO2
